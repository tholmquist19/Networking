For this program the objective is to send a syn packet to a server, receive a syn/ACK packet form the server and use that to send an ACK packet back and a tcp packet with a GET request to connect to the http server. In order to use the program you must run the file runlab6.sh by calling ./runlab6.sh.  That will then allow the packets to by sent and received without the OS freaking out and sending reset packets, and it will run lab6.py file for the servers httpforever, yahoo.com, and dominos.com as examples of the program.  Included is a .pcap file called test.pcap that has a packet capture of all the traffic gathered from running the runlab6.sh file.  This should show the correct sequence numbers, ack numbers and flags while also proving that a three way handshake occurred and a connection was made with the server.  In order to make this program work you need to install the scapy, socket, and urllib libraries.  In order to see the correct sequence numbers in the .pcap file you may need to change your settings by going to edit->preferences->protocols->TCP-> then uncheck the box for relative sequence numbers.
