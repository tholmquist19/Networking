For this lab you are able to specify in the command prompt a url you would like to receive outputted, along with the port number you want to use to connect to the url and if you would like the output printed to the screen or put into a file.  Included in this program is a bash file with sample inputs.  All that needs to be done to run this lab is navigate to the directory where lab3.py is located and run it using the command python3 lab3.py.  Then in a new terminal window navigate to where lab4.py is downloaded along with test.sh then use the command ./test.sh to run the sample file.  It may take a couple runs of the program to get the outputs to display for the samples that use lab3.  The input parameters are used correctly in the bash file but to clarify the first parameter specified in running the program tells the program whether you'd like the output to be printed to the screen or saved into a file called lab4output. If you put 's' for this parameter it will print to the screen and if you put 'f' for this parameter it will save the output into a file. The second parameter specified is the port number that you want to connect to.  This must be 80 for the httpforever website and for the lab 3 examples this port must be 5000.  Then lastly the third parameter put in is the full url of the website you would like to connect to. One of the examples in the bash file saves to a file and the other three print to the screen so you should only see three outputs in the terminal after running test.sh and to find the fourth output you can check the file lab4output.
