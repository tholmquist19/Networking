This program takes an input parameter of either a url or ip address of the destination you wan't to trace the route to. Once inputted the program will output the hops that it takes, the number of hops it takes, the AS's it traverses and the domain names of the hops that it takes to get to that address.  If the hop takes more than three seconds to be received back then it will return "***" for that hop.  It does this by first creating a syn packet that gets sent to the destination but starts at a TTL of 1 then increases each time it receives notice that the packet died and then records the information of the location it was at when it died until it finally reaches the destination.  The packages that were needed to make this program work were socket, urlib.parse and scapy.
