For this lab I have provided the sample outputs for google, amazon, yahoo, and youtube with the inputs varying between domain name and IP address.  I used the curl command in the runlab3.sh file that will run the commands necessary for the program, opening a url link that will run the program and display the output in the terminal.  All that is required to run this program is run the lab3.py file in one terminal then open up another terminal and run the runlab3.sh file.  This should output the correct items to the screen showing the completion of this lab.
